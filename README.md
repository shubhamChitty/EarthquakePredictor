Build an android app for predicting earthquake. The app would notify the users of the app seconds before the earthquake as well as tell the intensity of the earthquake.

Usually people don't realize the occurence of earthquake. They take minutes to realize occurence of earthquake. The app notifies the users some time ahead and gives opportunity to users to get to a safer place.
